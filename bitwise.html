    <h1>Bit Fields Explained (or, What Does <code>pte & PTE_P</code> Do?)</h1>
    <p>
      Numbers in computers are represented in binary. And binary numbers are
      made up of binary digits, or <em>bits</em> per short. A bit can either be
      a 1 or a 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      Operations can be applied to the individual bits of numbers. These
      operations are called <em>bitwise</em> operators.
    </p>
    <h2>~</h2>
    The <code>~</code>, or Bitwise NOT operator, takes all the 0s in a number
    and makes them 1s; and takes all the 1s and makes them 0s. For instance,
    consider the number <code>1234</code>, which is
    <code>00000000000000000000010011010010</code> as a 32-bit integer in binary.
